# <Portfolio>

## Description

This portfolio was created to showcase my work as I go through my coding Bootcamp at UCI. I created it to be an ongoing project I can update with my newest projects and refine as I learn more. It serves as a business card for myself as a new developer. It solves the problem of showing potential employers and collaborators what I can do and how I progress. I learned a lot about CSS layouts and Responsiveness while putting this together in its current status. 


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Access my page with the URL (https://jeremyskinner812.github.io/portfolio/) with any web browser and you can click on the links in the nav bar to scroll to the corresponding sections below if your screen is smaller. The resume link will be added at a later date. The first 2 projects have live links to a couple of projects done in class and the rest are currently placeholders. All the contact links will allow you to call, email, and access my LinkedIn and Github profiles.
